CHANGELOG:
    Template: VERSION_NUMBER - DESCRIPTION (BUILD SUCCESS/FAIL) [ADDITIONAL NOTES]

        0.0.1 - Initial commit (Success)

        0.0.2 - NOT UPLOADED

        0.0.3 - Very, very sloppy DSA implemented to generate terrain (Success)

        0.0.4 - Changed DSA to improved version, allowing for scalability (Success) [DSA is highly uneven]
        
        0.0.5 - Fixed DSA, optimized map generation (Success) [Huge step forward]
        
        0.0.6 - Some code improvement, addition of minor GUI items/utilities (Success)
        
        0.0.7 - Several major bugs become prominent, further GUI modifications (Success) [Buggy]
        
        0.0.8 - Began implementation of screens. (Success) [Still buggy]
        
        0.0.9 - Major GUI improvements, first successful screens, various fixes (Success)
            0.0.9_01 - Tiny modification to display terrain roughness in utils mode (Success)
            0.0.9_02 - Fixed FPS counter to accurately display framerate (Success)
        
TO-DO (In order of importance):
    Implement GUI
    Implement game mechanics
    Make DSA more realistic
    Implement scalable DSA
    Fix textures
    
BUGS:
    Template: [CODE - NUM](Importance)Description
    
    Codes:
        [GUI] - Specifically GUI problems (E.g. buttons aren't clickable)
        [VIS] - Messed up visuals not pertaining to [GRA] (E.g. improper positioning of graphics)
        [ALG] - Problems with algorithms (Most likely DSA)
        [MEC] - Problems with game mechanics (E.g. poor AI)
        [GRA] - Actual texture problems (E.g. uneven pixel count, poor graphics quality)
    
        [GUI - 001](Very high)GUI features end up off of screen because of bug
        [VIS - 001](Very high)Screen resolution uneven
        [VIS - 002](Very high)Improper screen positioning/Cutoff
        [GRA - 001](Normal)Textures slightly off-size
        [ALG - 001](Low)DSA slightly uncalibrated
        [GUI - 001](Low)Laggy selection box movement
